    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
      <strong>Martin Økter</strong> received his <strong>Master’s degree in Mechatronics</strong>
      from the <strong>University of Agder (UiA)</strong> in 2024, where he is currently pursuing
      a <strong>Ph.D. in Mechatronics</strong> as a <strong>Doctoral Research Fellow</strong>.
      He also holds a <strong>Bachelor’s degree in Mechatronics</strong> from UiA, completed in 2022.
    </p>

    <p>
      His research focuses on <strong>applied control theory for collaborative robots (cobots)</strong>,
      <strong>adaptive manufacturing techniques</strong>, and <strong>haptic feedback systems</strong>.
      In addition to his research activities, he has contributed to several educational initiatives
      in the Mechatronics program, including the development of <strong>laboratory equipment</strong>
      and <strong>teaching materials</strong> for courses in motion control and human–robot interaction.
      He has also supported the <strong>Haptic Summer School (EMERALD)</strong> through the design of
      experimental setups for teaching advanced haptic control concepts to graduate and postgraduate students.
    </p>

    <p>
      Alongside his academic work, Martin holds a <strong>part-time R&D Engineer position at Hive Autonomy</strong>,
      where he works on the development of <strong>autonomous and robotic systems</strong> for industrial applications.
    </p>

    <p>
      He is a <strong>member of the Norwegian Society of Mechatronics (NSOM)</strong> and has received recognition
      for his contributions to robotics education and applied research, including a
      <strong>Best Paper Award</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Through his independent initiative, <strong>IceCube Solution</strong>, he continues to explore practical
      applications of robotics and automation — combining his interests in
      <strong>3D printing, embedded systems, and experimental robotics</strong> with a hands-on approach
      to innovation.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong><em>IceCube Solution serves as a bridge between his research and creative engineering projects.</em></strong>
