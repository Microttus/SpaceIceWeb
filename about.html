    <h1>About</h1>

    <p>
      Martin Økter is a mechatronics researcher and engineer working at the intersection of
      robotics, control systems, and applied engineering. He is currently a Doctoral Research
      Fellow (Ph.D.) in Mechatronics at the University of Agder (UiA), where he also completed
      both his Master’s degree (2024) and Bachelor’s degree (2022) in Mechatronics.
    </p>

    <p>
      His research focuses on applied control theory for collaborative robotic systems,
      adaptive manufacturing methods, and haptic feedback in human–robot interaction.
      Alongside his research activities, he has contributed to several educational initiatives
      within the Mechatronics programme at UiA, including the development of laboratory
      equipment, experimental platforms, and teaching material for courses in motion control
      and human–robot interaction.
    </p>

    <p>
      A central practical focus throughout his studies has been additive manufacturing and
      3D printing. Martin previously held a position as a makerspace laboratory engineer,
      where he was responsible for the operation, maintenance, and repair of a printer park
      consisting of approximately 30 desktop and industrial-grade 3D printers. This role
      included printer calibration, troubleshooting of mechanical and electronic faults, and
      support for students and researchers using additive manufacturing in applied projects.
    </p>

    <p>
      In addition to managing existing systems, he has designed and built custom 3D printers
      and continuously follows developments in printing technologies, materials, and process
      optimization. His experience spans both prototyping and functional part production,
      with a strong emphasis on design for additive manufacturing and industrial applicability.
    </p>

    <p>
      In parallel with his academic work, Martin holds a part-time R&amp;D Engineer position at
      Hive Autonomy, where he contributes to the development of autonomous and robotic
      systems for industrial applications.
    </p>

    <p>
      He is a member of the Norwegian Society of Mechatronics (NSOM) and has received
      recognition for his contributions to robotics education and applied research, including
      Best Paper Awards at international conferences and journals.
