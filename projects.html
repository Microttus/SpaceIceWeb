      <h3>Goals</h3>
      <p>
        The goal of this project was to develop a safe, affordable, and fully
        sensorised elastic actuator suitable for prosthetic and orthotic devices.
        A key objective was to make compliant actuation accessible to students,
        researchers, and practitioners through an open-source hardware and
        software framework.
      </p>

      <h3>Scope</h3>
      <p>
        Research and development project conducted within an academic research
        group, resulting in a peer-reviewed HardwareX publication. The work
        covers mechanical design, electronics, control architecture, and
        experimental validation, with emphasis on reproducibility, modularity,
        and low-cost fabrication using 3D printing.
      </p>

      <h3>Implementation</h3>
      <p>
        The actuator is based on a series elastic actuator (SEA) architecture
        using a belt-driven DC motor, radial springs, dual encoders, load cells,
        and inertial sensing. Control software is implemented in embedded C++
        on low-cost microcontrollers and supports both impedance and admittance
        control. The complete system—including CAD files, schematics, firmware,
        and documentation—is released under an open-source license.
      </p>

      <h3>What I Learned</h3>
      <p>
        This project provided extensive experience in designing compliant robotic
        actuators for safe physical interaction. I gained deep insight into elastic
        actuator modelling, impedance and admittance control, sensor fusion, and
        real-time embedded programming. The work also strengthened my skills in
        research-driven development, experimental validation, and producing
        reproducible open-source hardware.

        <h2>Haptic Teleoperation for Industrial Robots</h2>

        <p class="project-ingress">
          Human-in-the-loop teleoperation of an industrial robot arm using a custom,
          low-cost haptic glove with real-time force feedback for pick-and-place tasks.

      <h3>Goals</h3>
      <p>
        The primary goal of this project was to design and evaluate a haptic teleoperation
        system that enables intuitive and safe control of an industrial robotic manipulator.
        A key objective was to convey meaningful force feedback to the operator, allowing
        them to adapt grip force and motion based on tactile cues rather than vision alone.
      </p>

      <h3>Scope</h3>
      <p>
        This project was developed as a research-oriented prototype with real-time
        performance constraints. The focus was on modularity, human–robot interaction,
        and experimental validation rather than production readiness. Emphasis was placed
        on low-cost hardware, 3D-printable mechanical components, and an open software
        architecture suitable for rapid iteration and future research.
      </p>

      <h3>Implementation</h3>
      <p>
        The system is implemented in C++ using ROS 2, with MicroROS-based microcontrollers
        handling distributed sensing and actuation. A custom-designed haptic glove tracks
        finger motion and provides force feedback using servo-actuated links and impedance
        control. The glove teleoperates an industrial robot arm equipped with a soft robotic
        gripper, enabling pick-and-place of objects with varying stiffness. The software
        architecture is fully modular, allowing vision, haptics, control, and robot interfaces
        to be developed and tested independently.
      </p>

      <h3>What I Learned</h3>
      <p>
        This project provided hands-on experience with designing real-time human–robot
        interaction systems, highlighting the challenges of stability, latency, and feedback
        fidelity in haptic control loops. I gained practical insight into ROS 2 system design,
        distributed control using microcontrollers, and impedance-based force feedback.
        The work also reinforced the importance of modular software architecture and
        mechanical simplicity when developing experimental robotic systems.

        <h2>Parametric Gear Generator</h2>

        <p class="project-ingress">
          Development of a parametric gear generation tool for designing and visualizing
          involute spur gears based on standard mechanical design parameters.
        </p>

    <div class="project-details">
      <h3>Goals</h3>
      <p>
        The goal of this project was to develop a parametric tool capable of generating
        accurate involute gear profiles from fundamental design parameters such as
        module, number of teeth, pressure angle, and profile shift. Emphasis was placed
        on correctness, flexibility, and clear geometric interpretation.
      </p>

      <h3>Scope</h3>
      <p>
        Course project focused on analytical modeling and implementation of gear
        geometry rather than CAD automation or manufacturing optimization. The tool
        is intended for educational use, early-stage design exploration, and validation
        of mechanical concepts.
      </p>

      <h3>Implementation</h3>
      <p>
        The gear generator was implemented in MATLAB using closed-form expressions
        for involute geometry and gear tooth construction. The script computes base,
        pitch, and addendum circles, generates tooth profiles parametrically, and
        visualizes complete gears by rotational replication. The implementation allows
        rapid iteration and immediate visual feedback when adjusting design parameters.
      </p>

      <h3>What I Learned</h3>
      <p>
        This project deepened my understanding of involute gear theory and the
        relationship between abstract design parameters and physical geometry.
        I gained experience translating mechanical design equations into robust,
        reusable code and learned the value of visualization as a validation tool
        for analytical models.

      <h3>Goals</h3>
      <p>
        The goal of this project was to design a safe and autonomous physical arena
        where drones can be trained using reinforcement learning techniques outside
        of simulation. The system aims to protect both the drone and its surroundings
        while enabling long-duration, unattended training cycles.
      </p>

      <h3>Scope</h3>
      <p>
        Bachelor-level group project focused on conceptual design, mechanical
        construction, and system architecture. The work emphasizes safety,
        modularity, and portability, while laying the foundation for future
        integration of reinforcement learning algorithms and distributed control.
      </p>

      <h3>Implementation</h3>
      <p>
        The arena consists of a modular mechanical structure with a central actuator
        system that repositions and reorients the drone to a known starting pose
        after each training iteration. A depth camera and visual markers are used
        to estimate drone position and orientation, while a Raspberry Pi controls
        arena actuators and peripheral hardware. The system is designed to
        communicate with an external computation unit responsible for vision
        processing and learning.
      </p>

      <h3>What I Learned</h3>
      <p>
        This project provided practical experience in designing safety-critical
        robotic systems and translating abstract research requirements into
        mechanical and architectural solutions. I gained hands-on experience with
        system-level design, sensor integration, and the challenges of bringing
        reinforcement learning concepts from simulation into physical environments.
        The work also highlighted the importance of modularity and maintainability
        in long-running autonomous systems.

      <p>
        The goal of this project was to create an affordable and portable
        mechatronics laboratory that enables students to perform meaningful
        hands-on experiments outside traditional university lab facilities.
        The platform was designed to strengthen the connection between theory
        and practice in instrumentation, measurement, and control.
      </p>

      <h3>Scope</h3>
      <p>
        Bachelor-level collaborative project focused on educational system
        design. The work includes mechanical design, electronics integration,
